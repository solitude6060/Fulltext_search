There are no approved drugs or biologics to treat Ebola virus disease (EVD). Literature reviews identified a list of 141 drugs with reports of preliminary in-vitro potency and/or in-vivo effectiveness in animals or with reports of clinical use/trials in EVD patients. The majority of these drugs have been individually approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating various non-EVD diseases. The anti-Ebola potency data of these drugs were curated from literature and publicly accessible databases, along with their individual biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic characteristics. To facilitate the development of anti-viral drugs including anti-EVD drugs, highlights include optimization of the exposure response relationship, design of a safe and effective clinical dosing regimen to achieve an adequate high ratio of clinical Cmin to a plasma protein binding-adjusted EC95, and the pharmacokinetic studies needed in animal models (healthy and affected) and in healthy volunteers. The exposure/response relationship for human dose selection is summarized, as described in the FDA "Animal Rule'' guidance when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.
