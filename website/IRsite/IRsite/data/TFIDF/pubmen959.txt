Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), one of five species in the genus Ebolavirus, is the causative agent of the hemorrhagic fever disease epidemic that claimed more than 11,000 lives from 2014 to 2016 in West Africa. The combination of EBOV's ability to disseminate broadly and rapidly within the host and its high pathogenicity pose unique challenges to the human immune system postinfection. Potential transmission from apparently healthy EBOV survivors reported in the recent epidemic raises questions about EBOV persistence and immune surveillance mechanisms. Clinical, virological, and immunological data collected since the West Africa epidemic have greatly enhanced our knowledge of host-virus interactions. However, critical knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of what is necessary for an effective host immune response for protection against, or for clearance of, EBOV infection. This review provides an overview of immune responses against EBOV and discusses those associated with the success or failure to control EBOV infection.
