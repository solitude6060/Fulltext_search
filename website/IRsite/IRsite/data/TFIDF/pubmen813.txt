In this review, Ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreaks have been comprehensively reviewed from their beginning until now. It chronologically discusses how each outbreak was tackled, national and international actions taken, diagnostic methods applied, the infection control procedures were put in place, and the lessons learnt from each epidemic for the control of subsequent epidemics. Data for this review were obtained from literature published between 1967 and 2016 in key medical databases, the official websites of various governmental organisations, international public health agencies, and regulatory bodies. Despite major developments in the field of EVD, there has been little progress in its specific therapy or prevention. Historically, individuals who recovered from EVD acted as a source of fresh frozen plasma (containing IgG) that has been used to treat other acutely ill patients, however this therapeutic modality has limitations due to the risk of transmission of blood-borne infections. With the use of advanced and efficient purification methods the incidence of unwanted side effects following immune serum therapy has currently been greatly reduced. Creation of a safe plasma pool that covers immunoglobulins against all strains of EVD is now a research priority. Recommendations on how future EVD outbreaks can be better managed have been discussed.
