Screening of monoclonal antibodies against ebolaviruses requires small-animal models. Wild-type mice require adaptation of ebolaviruses, whereas immunodeficient mice are still resistant to nonadapted Bundibugyo ebolavirus. Swapping of Ebola virus glycoprotein with that from Bundibugyo virus resulted in a replication-competent chimeric virus, which caused 100% lethal infection in STAT1 knockout mice. Monoclonal antibody BDBV223 isolated from a human survivor of Bundibugyo virus infection protected mice from challenge with the chimeric virus. These data demonstrate the suitability of the approach for in vivo screening of antibodies and suggest the greater contribution of internal Ebola proteins in pathogenesis compared to Bundibugyo virus proteins.
