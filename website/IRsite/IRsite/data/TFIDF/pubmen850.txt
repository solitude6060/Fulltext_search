Ebola virus infection causes severe disease in humans and represents a global health threat. Candidates for immunotherapeutics and vaccines have shown promise in clinical trials, though they are ineffective against other members of the Ebolavirus genus which also cause periodic, lethal outbreaks. Here, we present a crystal structure of a pan-ebolavirus antibody, 6D6, as well as single particle electron microscopy reconstructions of 6D6 in complex with Ebola and Bundibugyo virus glycoproteins. 6D6 binds to the conserved glycoprotein fusion peptide, implicating it as a site of immune vulnerability that could be exploited to reliably elicit a pan-ebolavirus neutralizing antibody response.
