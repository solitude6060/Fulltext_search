The Innovative Medicines Initiative is a public-private partnership between the European Union and the pharmaceuticals industry that was established in 2008, with an overall budget of â‚¬5.3 billion from 2008 until 2024. The objective of the initiative is to boost pharmaceutical innovation in Europe and speed up the development of innovative medicines, vaccines and medical technologies, in particular in areas with high unmet needs. This article discusses the objectives of the initiative, its governance and main results and impact. The initiative has proved to be a unique platform for multi-stakeholder collaborations across Europe. It has contributed to the acceleration of the development process for medicines, from drug discovery to clinical development. The initiative has made important steps towards accessing and using real-world evidence for pharmaceutical research and development, and for healthcare decision-making. Several projects have contributed to a better understanding of the causes of diseases, and some are already delivering results, such as a vaccine against Ebola virus. The initiative has also significantly contributed to building capacity and resources for open use by the broader research and innovation community.
