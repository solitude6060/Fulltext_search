Ebola virus is an important pathogen that emerged in Central Africa where it was responsible of numerous outbreaks of haemorrhagic fevers associated with a extremely high mortality rate (up to 90%). The filovirus pathogenicity is related to an inappropriate antiviral response. Indeed, this family of viruses has developed evasion strategies from early innate immunity mechanisms. As a result, a massive viral replication induces an unsuitable immune response causing an acute inflammatory reaction associated with the haemorrhagic syndrome. In this review, we describe the mechanisms adopted by filoviruses like Ebola virus to escape innate immunity response.
