The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa was more devastating than all previous EVD outbreaks combined; however, many estimates of its economic burden did not capture its significant social costs. This study aimed to review all currently available estimates, identify social components missed by these estimates, and generate a comprehensive cost of the 2014 EVD outbreak.We conducted a systematic review of the grey (reports produced by nonprofit or nongovernmental organizations, government, or industry) and published literature to identify current estimates of the burden of the outbreak. Based on the findings of this review, we identified 6 key areas absent or underestimated from previous estimates and calculated the underestimated social costs using estimates from the literature and extrapolation.Current estimates of the economic burden of the outbreak range from $2.8 to $32.6 billion in lost gross domestic product. We estimated the comprehensive economic and social burden from the 2014 EVD outbreak to be $53.19 billion (2014 USD). The most significant component, $18.8 billion, was deaths from non-Ebola causes.A more complete understanding of the burden of the 2014 EVD outbreak underscores the value of interventions that can mitigate or reduce the severity of future outbreaks.
