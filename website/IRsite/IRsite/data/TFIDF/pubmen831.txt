The West African outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection during 2013-2016 highlighted the need for development of field-applicable therapeutic drugs for this infection. Here we report that mannoside glycolipid conjugates (MGCs) consisting of a trimannose head and a lipophilic chain assembled by a linker inhibit EBOV infection not only of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages, but also of a number of susceptible cells. Analysis of the mode of action leads us to conclude that MGCs act directly on cells, notably by preventing virus endocytosis.
