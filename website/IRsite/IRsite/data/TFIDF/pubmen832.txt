During the late phase of the large West-African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, the majority of patients were cared for in designated treatment centers. However, the pre-existing health care infrastructure was overwhelmed with EVD in the first place. This had a huge impact on other, non-EVD related diseases, causing an un-preceded mounting of morbidity and mortality, which most likely exceeded the toll directly due to EVD. Consequently, one of the crucial questions is how to provide appropriate health care and safeguard functionality of a healthcare system also for all those patients not suspected or diagnosed to have EVD.We report here on the Lion Heart Medical Center experience in Sierra Leone and describe that a case definition broader than those commonly applied may be better suited in a scenario where it is of greater importance to identify atypically presenting, pauci-symptomatic cases.
