Sequencing of Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes during the 2014-16 epidemic identified several naturally-occurring, dominant mutations potentially impacting virulence or tropism. Here, we characterized EBOV variants carrying one of the following substitutions: A82V in the glycoprotein (GP), R111C in the nucleoprotein (NP), or D759G in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (L). Compared with wild-type EBOV/C07 (WT), NP and L mutants conferred a replication advantage in monkey VeroE6, human A549 and insectivorous bat Tb1.Lu cells, while L displayed a disadvantage in human Huh7 cells. GP mutant replication was significantly delayed in Tb1.Lu and similar to WT in other cells. The L mutant was less virulent, as evidenced by increased survival in mice and a significantly delayed time to death in ferrets, but increased lengths of EBOV shedding may have contributed to the prolonged epidemic. Our results show that single substitutions can have observable impacts on EBOV pathogenicity and provide a framework to study other mutations.IMPORTANCEDuring the Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreak in West Africa in 2014-16, it was discovered that several mutations in the virus emerged and became prevalent in the human population. This suggests that these mutations may play a role impacting viral fitness. We investigated three of these previously identified mutations (in the glycoprotein (GP), nucleoprotein (NP) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L)) in cell culture as well as in mice and ferrets by generating recombinant viruses (based on an early West African EBOV strain) carrying one of these mutations. The NP and L mutations appear to decrease virulence, whereas GP slightly increases virulence but mainly impacts viral tropism. Our results show that these single mutations can impact EBOV virulence in animals and have implications for the rational design of efficacious antiviral therapies against these infections.
