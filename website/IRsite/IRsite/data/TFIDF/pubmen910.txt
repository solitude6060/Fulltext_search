Rapid identification of emerging infectious pathogens is crucial for preventing public health threats. Various pathogen detection techniques have been introduced; however, most techniques are time-consuming and lack multiple-target detection specificity. Although multiple-target detection techniques can distinguish emerging infectious pathogens from related pathogens, direct amplification methods have not been widely examined. Here, we present a novel arch-shaped multiple-target sensor capable of rapid pathogen identification using direct amplification in clinical samples. In this study, an arch-shaped amplification containing primer sequences was designed to rapidly amplify multiple targets. Further, the sensing platform allowed for sensitive and specific detection of human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Zika virus, and Ebola virus down to several copies. This platform also simultaneously distinguished between Middle East respiratory syndrome and human coronavirus in clinical specimens within 20â€¯min. This arch-shaped multiple-target sensing assay can provide rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnoses of emerging infectious diseases in clinical applications.
