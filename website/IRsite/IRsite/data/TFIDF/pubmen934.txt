Vaccination practices in Germany are driven by scientific developments and a complex regulatory environment. Some important developments in 2018 are described here: Starting in 2018 only quadrivalent influenza vaccines will be used for the seasonal vaccination. Despite the availability of meningococcus ACWY and B vaccines and their use in other countries only the type C conjugate vaccine will be used for the routine vaccination of children. For the first time there is now an official recommendation to also vaccinate boys against HPV using either the bivalent or the nonavalent vaccine. After promising trial results a timely guideline for the use of the newly available adjuvanted subunit zoster vaccine is to be expected. Negative trial results mark a major setback for the development of a CMV vaccine. While only developed during the 2013 - 16 outbreak a highly effective Ebola vaccine is already being distributed to fight the current Congo outbreak.
