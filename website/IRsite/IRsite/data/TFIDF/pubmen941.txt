Antibody therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases and the success of ZMapp and other monoclonal antibody-based therapies during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak has shown this countermeasure can be a successful therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever. This study utilized transchromosomal bovines (TcB) vaccinated with a DNA plasmid encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein sequence to produce human polyclonal antibodies directed against Ebola virus glycoprotein. When administered 1 day postinfection, these TcB polyclonal antibodies provided partial protection and resulted in a 50% survival rate following a lethal challenge of Ebola virus Makona in rhesus macaques.
