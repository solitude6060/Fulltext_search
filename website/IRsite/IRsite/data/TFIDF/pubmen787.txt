During an Ebola outbreak, the WHO recommends that health professionals consider people as suspect cases (SCs) when they show key signs such as the sudden onset of high fever or specific symptoms after having had contact with a suspect or confirmed Ebola case. SCs should then get care, be isolated and be reported to health authorities until the Ebola virus disease is confirmed through a lab test. This exploratory study aims to understand this identification process in the field based on a qualitative analysis of the diagnosis and therapeutic itineraries of 19 SCs in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal (2014-2015). Results indicate that the main criteria for SC identification at the field level were fever (understood broadly) and provenance from a highly affected country (applied indiscriminately). WHO criteria were not followed in at least 9 of the 19 cases. Several medical, social and cultural factors favour over-identification of people as SCs, including relativism in defining 'high fever', placism, humanitarian or securitarian bias, issues in categorising SC's contact cases, and the context of fear. To avoid undue categorisation and its possible harmful social effects, the WHO definition should be implemented more carefully in various contexts and with greater consideration for ethical issues, while prioritising diagnosis strategies with higher specificity.
