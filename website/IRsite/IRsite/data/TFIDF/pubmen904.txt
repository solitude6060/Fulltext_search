The goal of this study was to purify and characterize Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP)-specific IgG antibodies from hybridoma clones.For hybridoma production, mice were injected by intramuscular-electroporation with GP DNA vaccines, and boosted with GP vaccines. The spleen cells were used for producing GP-specific hybridoma. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot assay, flow cytometry, and virus-neutralizing assay were used to test the ability of monoclonal IgG antibodies to recognize GP and neutralize Ebola virus.Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the presence of both IgG heavy and light chains by Western blot assay, were chosen as a possible IgG producer. Among these, five clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) were identified to secrete monoclonal IgG antibodies. When the monoclonal IgG antibodies from the 5 clones were tested for their antigen specificity, they recognized GP in an antigen-specific and IgG dose-dependent manner. They remained reactive to GP at the lowest tested concentrations (1.953-7.8 ng/mL). In particular, IgG antibodies from clones D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 recognized the native forms of GP expressed on the cell surface. These antibodies were identified as IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b kappa types and appeared to recognize the native forms of GP, but not the denatured forms of GP, as determined by Western blot assay. Despite their GP-binding activity, none of the IgG antibodies neutralized Ebola virus infection in vitro, suggesting that these antibodies are unable to neutralize Ebola virus infection.This study shows that the purified IgG antibodies from 5 clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) possess GP-binding activity but not Ebola virus-neutralizing activity.
