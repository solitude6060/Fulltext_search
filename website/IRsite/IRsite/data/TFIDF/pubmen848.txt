Acetylation of histones and other proteins plays crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, chromatin organization, and other biological processes. It has been recently reported that the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza virus is acetylated in infected cells, and this modification contributes to the RNA polymerization activity of the virus. As the influenza virus, the Ebolavirus contains single-stranded negative-sense RNA as its viral genome, which interacts with NP and other viral proteins. In this study, we performed a series of biochemical experiments and revealed that the recombinant Ebolavirus NP and the viral matrix protein VP40, which binds with NP, were acetylated by eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases, such as P300/CREB-binding protein (P300/CBP) and P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), inÂ vitro. Mass spectrometry was used to identify the lysine residues that were potential acetylation targets in NP and VP40. The identified lysine residues in NP were located in the RNA-binding cleft and the VP35-binding domain. Potentially acetylated lysine targets in VP40 were identified in the basic patch, which is necessary for constructing oligomers. These results suggest that the acetylation of these lysine residues is involved in the interactions between viral proteins.
