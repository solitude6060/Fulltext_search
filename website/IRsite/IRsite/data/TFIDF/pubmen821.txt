Lassa fever virus (LASV) is endemic in West Africa and causes severe hemorrhagic fever and sensorineural hearing loss. We identified a small molecule inhibitor of LASV and used it to analyze the mechanism of entry. Using a photo-reactive analog that retains antiviral activity as a probe, we identified the inhibitor target as lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), a host factor that binds to the LASV glycoprotein (GP) during infection. We found that LAMP1 binding to LASV GP is cholesterol-dependent, and that the inhibitor blocks infection by competing with cholesterol in LAMP1. Mutational analysis of a docking-based model identified a putative inhibitor binding site in the cholesterol-binding pocket within the LAMP1 domain that binds GP. These findings identify a critical role for cholesterol in LASV entry and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
