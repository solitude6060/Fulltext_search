The impact of the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment in Sierra Leone is unknown, especially for groups with higher HIV prevalence such as the military. Using a retrospective study design, clinical outcomes were evaluated prior to and during the epidemic for 264 HIV-infected soldiers of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF) and their dependents receiving HIV treatment at the primary RSLAF HIV clinic. Medical records were abstracted for baseline clinical data and clinic attendance. Estimated risk of lost to follow-up (LTFU), default, and number of days without antiretroviral therapy (DWA) were calculated using repeated measures general estimating equations adjusted for age and gender. Due to missing data, 262 patients were included in the final analyses. There was higher risk of LTFU throughout the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone compared to the pre-Ebola baseline, with the largest increase in LTFU risk occurring at the peak of the epidemic (relative risk: 3.22, 95% CI: 2.22-4.67). There was an increased risk of default and DWA during the Ebola epidemic for soldiers but not for their dependents. The risk of LTFU, default, and DWA stabilized once the epidemic was largely resolved but remained elevated compared to the pre-Ebola baseline. Our findings demonstrate the negative and potentially lasting impact of the Ebola epidemic on HIV care in Sierra Leone and highlight the need to develop strategies to minimize disruptions in HIV care with future disease outbreaks.
