The constant Ebola epidemic outbreaks in Africa arisen waves of panic worldwide. There is a high mortality rate (30-70%) among Ebola infected people in virus-stricken areas. Despite these horrors, the medical capabilities against this deadly viral disease were provided by limited therapeutic agents/options. As a result, several patented agents, biotherapies or prophylactic/therapeutic vaccines need to be reviving into the global markets-including patents of small molecular chemicals, short sequences or oligomers of DNA/RNA, linkages of chemicals with bio-molecules, herbal medicine and so on. In addition, the possible mechanisms of action of these therapeutic options are underway. To promote Ebola biomedical study, the multiple characters of Ebola infections-its origin, pathologic progresses, genomic changes, therapeutic context and economic considerations are outlined in this review. Finally a great difference can be expected after these types of efforts.
