Disruption in HIV care provision may enhance the development and spread of drug resistance due to inadequate antiretroviral therapy. This study thus determined the prevalence of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in settings of decentralized therapy and care in Senegal and, the Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Antiretroviral-naïve patients were enrolled following a modified WHO TDR Threshold Survey method, implemented in Senegal (January-March 2015) and Guinea (August-September 2015). Plasma and dried blood spots specimens, respectively from Senegalese (n = 69) and Guinean (n = 50) patients, were collected for direct sequencing of HIV-1 pol genes. The Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance program v6.0 was used for Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutations (SDRMs).Genotyping was successful from 54/69 (78.2%) and 31/50 (62.0%) isolates. In Senegal, TDR prevalence was 0% (mean duration since HIV diagnosis 4.08 ± 3.53 years). In Guinea, two patients exhibited SDRMs M184V (NRTI), T215F (TAM) and, G190A (NNRTI), respectively. TDR prevalence at this second site, however, could not be ascertained because of low sample size. Phylogenetic inference confirmed CRF02_AG predominance in Senegal (62.96%) and Guinea (77.42%). TDR prevalence in Senegal remains extremely low suggesting improved control measures. Continuous surveillance in both settings is mandatory and, should be done closest to diagnosis/transmission time and with larger sample size.
