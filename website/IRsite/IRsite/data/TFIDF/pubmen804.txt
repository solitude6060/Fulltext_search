Evaluation of people returning from trips abroad with fever is an important skill for all general physicians given the increasing trend in foreign travel. This evaluation should comprise a detailed travel history, thorough clinical examination, appropriate initial tests and a knowledge of when to ask for further advice. An understanding of the incubation periods of common imported infections and a syndromic approach to patients' symptoms is helpful in order to narrow down the likely diagnosis. The need to implement relevant infection control precautions has been highlighted by the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus disease outbreaks.
