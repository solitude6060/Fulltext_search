The filovirus, Zaire Ebolavirus (EBOV), infects tissue macrophages (Mϕs) and dendritic cells (DCs) early during infection. Viral infection of both cells types is highly productive, leading to increased viral load. However, virus infection of these two cell types results in different consequences for cellular function. Infection of Mϕs stimulates the production of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to the production of a cytokine storm, while simultaneously increasing tissue factor production and thus facilitating disseminated intravascular coagulation. In contrast, EBOV infection of DCs blocks DC maturation and antigen presentation rendering these cells unable to communicate with adaptive immune response elements. Details of the known interactions of these cells with EBOV are reviewed here. We also identify a number of unanswered questions that remain about interactions of filoviruses with these cells.
