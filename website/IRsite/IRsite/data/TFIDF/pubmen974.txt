At the onset of the 2013-2016 epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD), no vaccine or antiviral medication was approved for treatment. Therefore, considerable efforts were directed towards the concept of drug repurposing or repositioning. Amiodarone, an approved multi-ion channel blocker for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, was reported to inhibit filovirus entry in vitro. Compassionate use of amiodarone in EVD patients indicated a possible survival benefit. In support of further clinical testing, we confirmed anti-Ebola virus activity of amiodarone in different cell types. Despite promising in vitro results, amiodarone failed to protect guinea pigs from a lethal dose of Ebola virus.
